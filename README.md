# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my first machine learning and data exploration project! This notebook focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the famous Titanic dataset, helping understand the patterns behind passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform detailed EDA to uncover insights into what factors affected passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.  
This includes visual analysis, handling missing values, and feature understanding — the first step before building any ML model.
